WebProgramming_HW4

I only do the basic require. Please notice that there are some small bug that I don't have time to fix it.
The most important one is that you have to enter a message in your new chat room, or you can't find it after refresh you web page.
Hope it will not affact you to give me a pass ðŸ¥¹!
