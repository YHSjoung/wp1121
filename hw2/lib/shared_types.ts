// The beauty of using TypeScript on both ends of the application is that we can
// share types between the client and the server very easily. This is a great way
// to keep the client and server in sync and avoid bugs. JavaScript makes you move
// fast, but TypeScript makes you move fast and not break things.

// A "type" can be defined with the `type` keyword or the `interface` keyword.
// They may seem similar, but there are some differences. For more information,
// see: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#differences-between-type-aliases-and-interfaces
// A general rule of thumb is to always use `type` unless you have a good reason
// to use `interface`. `interface` is more powerful, at the cost of baring more
// footguns.
